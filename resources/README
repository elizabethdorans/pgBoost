training_data.tsv.gz: positive and negative training instances derived from fine-mapped GTEx eQTL (see https://www.finucanelab.org/data 'GTEx fine-mapping results'). Positive SNP-gene pairs are defined by PIP > 0.2, and negative SNP-gene pairs are defined by PIP < 0.01.

SNPs.bed.gz: 1kG SNPs with MAF count > 5.

TSS.txt.gz: TSS coordinates for genes in gene universe (derived from https://github.com/EngreitzLab/CRISPR_comparison/tree/main/resources/genome_annotations).
